#Enable Dark Theme
This doesn't work as well as it did in the beta, but it still changes some things
Run "Make Windows 10 Use Dark Theme.reg" to enable, run "Make Windows 10 Use Light Theme.reg" to disable

To make Edge use dark theme, go to Settings -> Theme -> Dark.

To make Windows Store use dark theme, press control+t with it up (This appears to not work on the release of Windows 10).
